        <h2>Brief introduction</h2>
        <p><em>It is very important to exercise!</em> 
            A good way to make sure that you have enough energy for school is to stay active. Walk, run or swim, just make sure that you do something.</p>
        <h2>Spare time</h2>
        <p><q>I think therefore I am</q> is a famous quote by Ren√© Descartes. 
            I would change this to: <q>"I MITB, therefore I am."</q> This becomes more obvious if you look at my trainings schedule below.</p>
